# Economy
All activities pertaing to the production and consumption of limited resources(goods, services) by a defined group of people(state, region, country).

## Capitalism
A system in which private individuals and businesses own capital goods. Production of goods is controlled by supply and demand(market economy).

**Laissez-faire capitalism** or pure capitalism/free market is where private individuals decide how much and at what price they produce, sell and invest in goods with no restrictions.

On the other end of the spectrum you have pure socialism where production is completely controlled by the government.

### Free Enterprise
A system in which private businesses can operate without government coercion. 

### Pillars of Capitalism
* *private property* - by allowing a private entity to own property it incentivizes it to maximize that properties value
* *profit* - property has subjective value based on which it is traded. Suppliers compete with eachother to sell their goods and services to consumers, while consumers compete with eachother to buy goods and services which balances out supply and demand. By properly managing production and sales of goods and services you can make more than you spend turning a profit.

### Mixed System
In the modern world a mixed economic system(in between pure capitalism and pure socialism) is usually implemented where some degree of restrictions are placed on property owners. These may include:
* *minimum wage laws* - 
* *tariffs* - 
* *quotas* - 
* *windfall taxes* - 
* *license restrictions* - 
* *prohibited products* - 
* *prohibited contracts* - 
* *direct public expropriation* - 
* *anti-trust legislation* - 
* *legal tender laws* - 
* *subsidies* - 
* *eminent domain* - 
* *public goods* - 

**Crony capitalism** is a form of a mixed economic system where certain business have a close relationship with the state. This results in a certain degree of favoritism shown by the government and expressed through government grants, tax breaks and other incentives.

### History of Capitalism
1. *Feudalism* - economic system in which most people worked as serfs for nobles in exchange for basic goods(food, shelter)
1. *Mercantilism* - economic system in which goods and services where traded between towns, counties, provinces and countries
1. *Capitalism* - privately owned goods and services which are produced based on supply and demand.
