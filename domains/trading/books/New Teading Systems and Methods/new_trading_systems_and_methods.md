# Terminology
* `fat tail` - large cluster of outliers in distribution
* `Runs` - hours / days when prices continue in the same direction for an unusually long sequence
* `Systematic Technique` - having clear rules that can be automated
* `Technical Analysis` - systematic evaluation of price, volume, breadth, and open interest, for the purpose of price forecasting
* `Transparent solution` - a trading solution in which you can readily understand the operation of each part of it

&nbsp;
# Introduction


## The Expanding Role of Technical Analysis
* integrity of research produced by major financial houses is doubtful
* company data released by large and small firms is doubtful
* decisions made based on clear rules and calculations that can be audited are safe from scrutiny
* extensive quantitative trading exists around the world:
    * `interest rate arbitrage` -> major source of revenue for banks
    * `location arbitrage` -> process that keeps price of precious metals same across the globe
    * `program trading` -> keeps price of stocks within a narrow band of the S&P futures and Spyder prices


## Convergence of Trading Styles in Stocks & Futures
* **trading futures** involves:
    * `short holding period` -> future contacts expire every 2 / 3 months
    * `high leverage` -> the buyer only needs to deposit a small value like 5% for a contract
    * `low commissions` -> fee is close to `.05%` per trade for broker commissions
    * short sales where always popular
* **trading stocks**:
    * used to involve long holding period, low leverage and high commisions
    * short selling used to be banned in many markets
    * over the years volume increased greatly, commission fell to that of futures and short selling is made available
* methods of trading futures and trading stocks due to the above is converging


## Fundamentals & Technicals
* market is driven by:
    * fundamentals
    * consumer confidence
    * supply & demand
    * geopolitical factors
    * expectations of price movement
* data used to make fundamental decisions is not reliable
* `technical approach`
    * objective & self-contained
    * accuracy of data is certain
* price movements reflected in market are anticipatory
* markets react to accuracy of estimates - not economic data itself
* by the time public is ready to act -> news is already reflected in the price


## Professional & Amateur
* `amateur` -> can find simple method that seems to have been overlooked by professionals. Why?
    * risk higher than expected
    * cant get good execution with the system
    * too many losses in a row
* `professional`
    * invest time over money -> have realistic expectations
    * act on new that has not yet been printed
    * recognize recurring patterns -> determine most likely results of such patterns
    * determine `trend` of the market by isolating basic direction of prices over selected time interval
* a `price trend` is not a universally accepted concept -> many studies published claiming price trends do not exist


## Random Walk
* `Random Walk Theory` -> no significant correlation betwen what was and what is
    * price will seek balance between "supply" & "deemand"
    * when this balance will be achieved and what happens on the way is not known
* facts that argue **AGAINST** random walk theory
    1. success of many fully `technical trading strategies`
    1. prices `move on anticipation` - mostly traders have an idea of how an event will effect prices and what other events might follow a specific event
    1. prices do `not` have `normal distribution`
    1. prices do `not` move in `symmetric patterns`
    1. existence of `fat tails` in distribution - proof that some part of the distribution differs from norm
* `less frequent` data = more easy to `isolate trend`
* `more frequent` data = `more noise` (random movement)
* in long run -> prices seek `equilibrium`
    * `stocks` -> ROI (share apprciation + dividends) balanced with risk of the investment
    * `treasury notes` -> risk-free investment
    * `futures` -> balance betweeen supply & demand
* finding differences beetween chart of random numbers & chart of actual data = profit


## Background Material
* should understand
    * stock market
    * related futures market (S&P 500, Treasure notes)
    * working of buy / sell orders
    * specifications of contracts in futures

## Research Skills
* **Guidelines**:
    1. `Know what you want to do before you start`
        * base technique on an underlying premise
        * implement solution for EXPLORATION to find a premise
    1. `State your idea or question in its simplest form`
        * easier to test simple method
        * complex methods dont usually work as well as easy ones
    1. `Do not assume anything`
        * be critical of everything
        * prove everything to your own satisfaction
    1. `Try the simplest and most important parts first`
        * understand how each rule contributes to the system
        * build slowly and carefully to prove the value of each element of the system
    1. `Build one step at a time`
        * move on to next step only after thorough testing of previous step
        * failure in a complex system requires breaking it down into pieces to understand the root cause of the failure
        * **transparent solution** - ability to readily uunderstand the operation of each part of your system
    1. `Watch  for errors of omission`
        * continuously review your work
        * continuously validate your solution against ever changing circumstances
        * ask yourself if youve included all necessary costs / risks
        * important questions may be missing
    1. `Question the good results`
        * tendency to look for errors when results are bad
        * tendency to accept results when results are good
        * exceptionally good results - just as likely to be caused by errors in rules / formulas / data
        * check exgtremely good results like extremely bad results
    1. `Do not take shortcuts`
        * check the work of others carefully
        * do not use external solutions if they cannot be verified
        * one error can ruin all of your work -> test thoroughly
    1. `Start at the end`
        * define goal -> work backward to define required input
        * working backwards you ensure you only work with information relevant to the result


## Objectives of This Book
* show systematic trading strategies
* evaluate conditions under which certain methods `likely to do better` or can be `harmful to specific approaches`


## Profile of a Trading System
* things to consider when creating a trading system:
    * **Changing Methods & System Longevity**
        * markets evolve
        * markets affected by:
            * `technology` - accelerated trading process, easier to trade and get information
            * `participation` - more ppl participate in trading increasing noise -> largest, constant flow of orders placed for unrelated reasons
            * `globalization` - same information at the same time, everywhere
            * `cost of doing business` - reduced price of commission for trading
        * adept system to what affects the market and how the trading landscape changes
    * **Choice of Data**
        * system limited by used data
        * volume / price most obvious criteria
        * multitude of other data points that can be important
    * **Diversification**
        * less diversification often = reduced returns & limited risk
        * diversification can be achieved by:
            * trading different markets
            * trading different strategies on same market
    * **Time Frame**
        * time frame impacts `type of system` and `characteristics of results`
        * smaller time-frame = more noise = more difficult to find trend
        * longer time-frame = less noise = more focus on trend following over other techniques
        * no universal trading system that works in all time frames
    * **Choosing a Method of Analysis**
        * some methods are more compelxe than others
        * complexity does not equal profitability
        * all good trading methods begin with `sound premise`
        * start with something simple that coincides with the premise - like moving average for higher timeframes
    * **Trade Selection**
        * dont act on each trade
        * add method filtering -> can be:
            * confirmation of another system / technique
            * limitation on amount of risk
            * use of outisde information
            * current volume
        * careful: too many filters = no trading
    * **Testing**
        * backtesting = only option to confirm / validate ideas
        * testing SHOULD NOT be used to discover by scanning combinations of techniques
        * testing SHOULD be used to validate idea and show robustness
        * testing SHOULD provide a good indication of expectation for returns * risk
        * robust solution = works on many financial isntruments & across many similar markets
    * **Risk Control**
        * trading survival depends on risk control
        * risk must be address per `individual trade` -> entry / exit signals that minimize losses
            * example: simple but fast trend method
            * example: stop-loss
        * risk must also be managed at `portfolio level` -> diversification & size allocation to each asset & leverage
        * risk management has `many tiers`
    * **Order Entry**
        * have realistic expectations -> consider: `slippage`, `commissions`, `transaction costs`
        * short-term trading is more sensitive to transactioins costs
        * directional trading has larger slippage then mean reversion techniques
        * eqaul damage in: `overestimating` & `underestimating` costs
    * **Performance Monitoring & Feedback**
        * system is not done when you begin trading
        * monitor results & compare with expectations
        * slippage = changes to system rules & size of position traded
        * proper monitoring can put a losing system back on track
