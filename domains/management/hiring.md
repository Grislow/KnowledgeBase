## Interested
I heard you are interested in new ventures as a {position name}. Iâ€™d love to tell you about our project and hear about your past experience. Let me know when we can have a 30 min meeting. The sooner the better!

## First meeting
Great! How does next {weekday} {from}-{to} sound to you? 

It would be great if you can prepare something to show. A project(or a few) you worked on and can walk me through with screen sharing. I prefer to assess based on hands-on experience over raw technical knowledge. Thx!
