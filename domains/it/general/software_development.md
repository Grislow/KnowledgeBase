# Software Requirement Specification
An SRS is a specification of all business requirements a software product should meet. This is especially useful for validating the feasibility of the product in question and communicating what needs to be created to the software team or a software vendor. 

An SRS should contain:
* __Functional requirements__ - detailed description of all the functions performed by the system
* __Non-functional requirements__ - usability, performance, maintenance requirements and more
* __User stories__ - detailed description of what the user can do with the software
* __Sketches and wireframes__ - functional mockups and target mockups that show how the product will be used


&nbsp;
# Discovery
Purpose is to ensure product development is going in a direction that provides value to the business, by reiterating on the products feasibility before committing too much work.
