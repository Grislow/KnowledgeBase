# What is S3
A range of storage classes for various use cases.

# Key concepts
* **Object** - file and any metadata that describes it
* **Bucket** - container for objects
    * up to 100 buckets on a single account
* **Keys** - unique identifiers for objects within buckets
* **S3 versioning** - enables storing multiple versions of the same object

# Storage Classes
* **S3 Standard** - frequent access
* **S3 Standard-IA** or **S3 One Zone-IA** - infrequent access
* **S3 Glacier** - archive data

# Storage Management
* **S3 Lifecycle** - lifecycle policies for stored objects determine when, on which storage classes they should be stored
* **S3 Object Lock** - prevent objects from being deleted or overwritten
* **S3 Replication** - replicate objects with mtadata to other regions fro reduced latency, compliance, security
* **S3 Batch Operations** - invoke operations like Copy, AWS Lambda functions, and Restore through the S3 API.

# Access Management
* **S3 Block Public Access** - block access to bucket or object, turned on by default on account and bucket level
* **AWS IAM** - control access through IAM users and groups
* **Bucket policies** - use IAM-based policies to configure resource-based permissions
* **S3 access points** - named network endpoints with dedicated access policies
* **Access control lists(ACLS)** - grant permissions to authorized users. Not recommended 
* **Access Analyzer for S3** - evaluate and monitor S3 bucket access policies

# Data Processing
* **S3 Object Lambda** - trigger own code on GET requests to S3 objects
* **Event notifications** - trigger workflows that use AWS SNS, AWS SQS or AWS Lambda when changes are made to S3 resources

# Storage logging and monitoring
* Automated logging
    * **Amazon Cloudwatch metrics for Amazon S3** - operational health and billing alerts
    * **AWS CloudTrail** - record actions taken by a user, role, AWS service. API tracking for S3 resources
* Manual logging
    * **Server access logging** - detailed records on requests 
    * **AWS Trusted Advisor** - evaluate account against AWS best practice checks

# Analytics and insights
* **Amazon S3 Storage Lens** - usage and activity metrics on interactive dashboard
* **Storage Class Analysis** - analyze access patterns to decide when its time to move data to a different storage class
* **S3 Inventory with Inventory reports** - audit and reports on objects and their metadata
