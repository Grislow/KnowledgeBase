# Definition
Scrum is a __lightweight__, __simple to understand__ and __difficult to master__ project management framework which facilitates adapting to changes while delivering high value products.

Scrum consists of Events and Items that are immutable. Removing any one part can jeopordize the worth of remaining elements.

&nbsp;
# Scrum Theory
Scrum is based on empiricism which asserts that knowledge comes from experience. Decision are made based on what is known.

The three pillars of scrum are:
* __Transparency__\
    Aspects of the process must be visible and understandable by those responsible for the outcome of the project. A common language must be shared by all participants.
* __Inspection__\
    Scrum artifacts and progress towards a Sprint Goal must be inspected often in order to detect undesirable variances.
* __Adaption__\
    In case of unacceptable deviations adjustments must be made as soon as possible to minimize further deviation.

Inspection and adaption happen during:
1. Sprint planning
1. Daily Scrum
1. Sprint Review
1. Sprint Retrospective

Scrum is all about enforcing the following five values in team members:
* __commitment__ - to achieving the Scrum teams goals
* __courage__ - to do the right thing and work on tough problems
* __focus__ - on the tasks in a given sprint
* __openness__ - about challenges and work that is being performed
* __respect__ - cooworkers to be capable and independent

&nbsp;
# Scrum Team
Scrum Teams consist of three roles and are designed to be flexible, creative, productive and self-sufficient. Products are delivered iteratively and incrementally maximizing feedback and minimizing reaction time. 

## Product Owner
Maximizies the value of the product. 

Is responsible for managing the __Product Backlog__:
* clearly expresses backlog items
* ordering backlog items
* optimizing the value of performed work
* ensures transparency and visibility of backlog
* ensures the team understands the backlog

## Development Team
Professionals that work on the product. Are responsible for delivering a releasable Increment of a "Done" product at the end of each Sprint.

Characteristics:
* self-organizing - only they are responsible for turning Product Backlog into Increments
* cross-functional - have all the necessary skills to create an Increment
* no sub-teams
* no individual titles
* the team is accountable as a whole
* 3-9 team members

## Scrum Master
Promotes and supports Scrum guidelines. The scrum master serves the scrum team in a way the maximizes productivity.

Service to __Product Owner__:
* ensures goals, scope, product domain are understood by everyone
* finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management
* ensures Product Owner knows how to organize Product Backlog
* facilitates Scrum Events

Service to __Development Team__:
* coaching in self-organization and cross-functionality
* helping team create high value products
* removing obstacles to progress
* facilitates Scrum Events
* coaching in Scrum

Service to __Organization__:
* leading and coaching in Scrum
* planning scrum implementation
* causing change that promotes productivity
* working with other Scrum Masters

&nbsp;
# Scrum Events
Scrum Events should be regular and minimize the need for non-scrum meetings. Each meeting should be __time-boxed__, with no exceptions. Once a time is determined it cannot be extended.

Each event except for the Sprint itself is an opportuninty to inspect and adapt.

## Sprint
A container for all other Scrum Events. Can be considered a mini-project in its own.

__Characteristics__
* __involves__ - Scrum Team, stakeholders
* __time__ - < 1 month ; any longer would increase risk, complexity and possibility of changes
* __result__ - a "Done", useable, potentailly releasable product Increment
* __cyclic__ - a new sprint starts immediately after the previous one ends

__During__
* no changes are made that endanger meeting Sprint Goal
* scope may be clarified and re-negotiated
* quality goals do not decrease

__Process__
1. 1 x Sprint Planning
1. n x Daily Scrum
1. 1 x Sprint Review
1. 1 x Sprint Retrospective

## Sprint Planning
Planning out the work that is to be performed during the Sprint. Determines what is delivered and how. Estimates are made by the Development Team and can be denotated by hours or story points.

__Story Points__ - a value of time equal to how long it takes to implement a selected smallest feature

__Characteristics__
* __involves__ - Scrum Team
* __time__ - < 8 hours
* __result__ - [Sprint Backlog](#sprint-backlog)

What can be delivered?
* based on the Product Backlog
* based on latest Increment
* based on projected capacity of the Development Team
* based on Development Team past performance
* the Development Team decides number of items selected from the Product Backlog
* __Sprint Goal__
    * objective that will be met through the implementation of the Product Backlog
    * provides guidance for the Development Team on why it is building the increment
    * make sure Increment delivers a coherent function
    
How will work be achieved?
* designing the system
* converting the Product Backlog into a working product Increment
* technical or domain advice
* trade-off assesment by Product Owner
* Development Team can explain how it will achieve the anticipated Increment



## Daily Scrum
A short meeting held every day that plans the day of work, facilitates inspection, pin-points and plans resolution of bottlenecks. The Development Team is responsible for conducting the Daily Scrum.

Make sure the Daily is held at the same hour and at the same location to reduce confusion.

__Characteristics__
* __involves__ - Development Team
* __time__ - =15 minutes
* __result__ - plan for next 24h

__Typical Agenda__
* what did I do to help meet the Sprint Goal
* what will I do to help meet the Sprint Goal
* do i see any obstacles that prevent me or the team from meeting the Sprint Goal

__Benefits__
* improved communication
* eliminate non-scrum meetings
* identify obstacles
* highlight and promote quick decision making
* improve Development Team level of knowledge

## Sprint Review
A meeting held at the end of a Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog. This usually happens with the involvement of the whole Scrum Team and stakeholders. 

__Characteristics__
* __involves__ - Scrum Team, stakeholders
* __time__ - < 4 hours
* __result__: 
    * revised Product Backlog
    * definition of Backlog items for next iteration
    * potentail Backlog change do to revision 

__Elements__
* Scrum Team and stakeholders
* __Product Owner__ - explains what in the Product Backlog is "Done" and what is not "Done"
* __Development Team__ - explains what went well, any encountered obstacles, how they were solved
* __Development Team__ - demonstrates works that is "Done", answers questions about Increments
* __Product Owner__ - discusses Product Backlog as is. Projects targets for next Sprint
* __Entire Group__ - discusses how potential use of product could have changed
* __Entire Group__ - discusses what the most valuable thing to do next is
* __Entire Group__ - reviews timeline, budget, potential capabilities, marketplace of the next Increment


__Benefits__
* elicit feedback
* foster collaboration


## Sprint Retrospective
Meeting during which the Scrum Team inspects itself and creates a plan for improvements.

__Characteristics__
* __involves__ - Scrum Team
* __time__ - < 3 hours
* __result__: identified improvements that will be implemented in next Sprint

__Purpose__
* inspect last Sprint pertaining to people, relationships, processes, tools
* identify and order what went well
* identify what can be improved
* create a plan to implement improvements in how the Scrum Team works

&nbsp;
# Scrum Artifacts
Work or value to provides transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaption. 

Artifact Transparency is paramount in a Scrum Project. If artifact are not transparent risk increases and any decisions based on the artifacts may be flawed. Transparency doesnt occur over night and requires involves constant learning, convincing and change. 

## Product Backlog
An ordered list of everything that is needed in the product. It is the single source of requirements for changes to be made to the product. The Product Backlog is always work in progress.

The Product Backlog should be monitored at all time to track progress to completion of Sprint Goal.

__Responsiblity__ - Product Owner

__Characteristics__
* never complete
    * items can be effective by various factors including __busiess requirements__, __market conditions__, __technology__
* evolves as the environment in which it is used evolves
    * undergoes regular refinement where items are review and revised
    * refinement consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team
* constantly changes to identify what the product needs to be:
    * appropriate
    * competetive
    * useful
* lists all that consitutes changes made in future releases:
    * features
    * functions
    * requirements
    * enhancements
    * fixes
* backlog items have the following attributes:
    * __description__
    * __order__ - priority, higher order items should have a more detailed description
    * __estimate__ - how long it should take to complete, Development Teams responsibility
    * __value__ - what value it bring to the product
    * __test descriptors__ - define what tests need to pass in order to consider the item "Done"
    * __group__ - if multiple Scrum Teams are working on the same product


## Sprint Backlog
A set of Product Backlog items selected for a Sprint and the plan for delivering them. A forecast by the Development Team about what functionality needs to implemented for a "Done" Increment.

Should include at least one high priority process improvement identified in the previous Retrospective meeting.

The Sprint Backlog can be modified during the Sprint.

__Responsiblity__ - Development Team

## Increment
The sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during the current Sprint and all previous Sprints. A new Increment must be "Done" and inspectable.

__Responsiblity__ - Development Team

## User Story
Smallest unit of work representing a single feature or item in the Scrum Backlog described from the users perspective.

> As a {type_of_user}, i want a {goal} so that I can {reason}

Guidelines:
* __User Stories != Tasks__ - tasks are about implementation, user stories are definitions
* __Simple and Solid__ - use simple and accurate language so that all parties can understand it
* __Understand the Users__ - capture the users profiles, points of view, expectations and pain points to properly create user stories
* __Think as a User__ - the whole scrum team need to create user stories based on how a user would use the product
* __Think Big__ - its better to have more than less in the backlog. Administration overhead is small while this increases product clarity, visions and opportunities.
* __Use Epics__ - use epics as a form of higher-level story that encompasses various lower level stories
* __Dont discard stories__ - manage noise from large amount of user stories by prioritizing, not discarding
* __Prioritize skillfully__ - prioritizing is a complicated process and requires:
    * estimate value of story for the user and for the business
    * size the complexity
    * estimate the feasability
    * estimate the cost/effort to build and release feature
    * identify cross-dependencies in backlog
* __Tag stories__ - for easier navigation and administration always tag your stories

### INVEST
A set of criteria to assess the quality of user stories.

A good user story should be:
* `I`ndependent - of all othe user stories
* `N`egotiable - not a specific contract for features
* `V`aluable
* `E`stimable - to a good approximation
* `S`mall - to fit within an iteration
* `T`estable - in principal
